	this is renamed to station_data.json
all_trips.json - amount of traffic - size of arc for all stations (not when you select a single one)
array_scores_minify.json - time-based - metrics - used for graphs
	renamed to data_bytime.json
station_aggregate.json - size of arcs for just one station selected - all day
station_data.json - used for loading the dropdown - we should replace this with the first json -- we should also only load this once.
